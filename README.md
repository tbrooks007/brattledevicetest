=================

This project explores connecting and interacting with two bluetooth devices in an iOS app. This proof of concept shows that it is possible to connect a mind wave headset and sphero robotic ball in the same app and have data output from one control the other. This was done to explore the possiblity of continuing development on the Brattle game devleoped during the 2012 CodeFabe Mobile DevCamp NYC. For some information on the game we developed see this link below:  http://technoverseblog.com/2012/04/devcamp-mobile-nyc-sphero-ball-of-fun/
